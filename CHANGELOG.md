# DeckUI changelog

What users see on the CurseForge file page and in the app. `changelog.ps1`
reads the section whose heading matches the version being released, so the
heading has to be `## <version>` - the rest of the line is free, a date is
welcome. Write for players: what changed for them, not which file moved.
Without a matching section a release falls back to the commit subjects,
which is duller but never blocks a release. A pre-release reads the section
of the version it leads up to, so `v1.0.1-beta` uses `## 1.0.1`.

## 1.0.1

Nothing has changed in the addon itself: 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 hold the same four
addons, file for file. This build exists to put the automated upload through
its paces, so there is nothing you need to do. Settings, frame positions and
key bindings carry over untouched.

## 1.0.0

First public beta.

- Round unit frames (orbs) for player, target, target of target, focus, pet
  and the boss frames.
- An FFXIV-style cross hotbar: LT/RT together with the D-pad and the face
  buttons on a controller, your own action bar bindings on a keyboard.
- One-click specialization switching.
- Settings are per device: frame positions and the orb and cross sizes are
  remembered separately for the Steam Deck and the PC, so the same account
  fits both screens.
- ConsolePort users: uncheck "Console Port Action Bar", which claims the
  same LT/RT combinations and wins, leaving the DeckUI crosses unlit.
  Everything else in ConsolePort works fine next to DeckUI.
